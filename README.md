The goal of this project is to pull the River Gauge Data from wateroffice.ec.gc.ca and tweet the water level <br>

1) You will need to create a Twitter Account and get Application Tokens
https://apps.twitter.com/app
2) Insert the generated keys in auth.json
3) Modify the stationList to include the River Gauge you are interested in
3) Setup a Cron Scheduling Job on your server
4) Happy Tweeting

Champlain Bridge<br>
Below 58.5 - eddy is small, you have to portage up island for each ride, waves are small.<br>
58.5 - the eddy is in, but rope needed to reattain the top<br>
58.7 - you can paddle up the eddy with effort<br>
59.0 - the eddy is full with little effort needed to paddle up, the waves are steep and retentive<br>
Above 59.1 - you are recirculated to the top of eddy and the waves continue to be great. The higher the water level the more the the playspots become breaking waves and lose their hole character.<br>
<br><br>
Sewer Wave<br>
The waves are best between 58.4 and 58.7<br>

Simplified Water Level Description<br>
>= 58.4 < 58.5     "Go check out Sewer Wave!"<br>
>= 58.5 < 58.7     "Go to Sewer Wave or Champlain with Rope."<br>
>= 58.7 > 59       "Go check out Champlain"<br>
>= 59.1           "Champlain is HUGE!!"<br>
