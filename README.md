The goal of this project is to pull the River Gauge Data from wateroffice.ec.gc.ca and tweet the water level

Data Source
Example for BRITANNIA

Champlain Bridge
Below 58.5 - eddy is small, you have to portage up island for each ride, waves are small.
58.5 - the eddy is in, but rope needed to reattain the top
58.7 - you can paddle up the eddy with effort
59.0 - the eddy is full with little effort needed to paddle up, the waves are steep and retentive
Above 59.1 - you are recirculated to the top of eddy and the waves continue to be great. The higher the water level the more the the playspots become breaking waves and lose their hole character.

Sewer Wave
The waves are best between 58.4 and 58.7

Simplified Water Level Description
>= 58.4  < 58.5   # Go check out Sewer Wave!
>= 58.5  < 58.7   # Sewer Wave or Champlain with Rope
>= 58.7  < 59     # Champlain with Effort
>= 59.1           # Go check out Champlain!
